LSP (Language Server Protocol) with the GlobalFilter box is able to validate the user input. It also proposes completions to the user input (operator, TID, PID) and basic syntax highlighting is there is an error in the user input. The LSP4J eclipse plug-in is required, but it is downloaded automatically with the incubator plug-in. The LSP client and server automatically launch with the TraceCompass application.
