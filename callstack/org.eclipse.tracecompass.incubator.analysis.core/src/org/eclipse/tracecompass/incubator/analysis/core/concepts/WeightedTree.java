/**
 * A Weighted Tree class to describe hierarchical data with a weight. This class
 * is a concrete class to describe a simple weighted tree, but it is also meant
 * to be extended to support other metrics associated with each tree, apart from
 * the weight.
 *
 * Note that the weight is such that the sum of the weight of the children is
 * smaller or equal to the weight of the parent. Failure to comply to this will
 * result in undefined behaviors when viewing the results.
 *
 * Also, if a child is added to the weighted tree for an object that is already
 * present in the children of this tree, their data will be merged.
